# Elite Dangerous Trading Assistant

This application is an experiment with the graph database [Neo4j][1]. It is not
intended for any serious use but if you are an enthusiast of the game and either
want to help develop it or use it yourself, then please feel free.

At some point, I will add a how-to to this README to demonstrate how to install
the system.

I could also expand this to create stars (some systems have more than one),
planets and so on and create orbits to represent each system more accurately.

But that's for another day :)
